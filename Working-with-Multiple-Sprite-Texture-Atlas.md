Sometimes a sprite texture contains just a single graphic element but it is often more convenient to combine several related graphics together into a single image. For example, the image could contain component parts of a single character, as with a car whose wheels move independently of the body. 

Unity provide a Multiple Sprite Mode in using sprite image. It allows multiple images combined into a single image. But the UV coordinate is different from the normal single image sprite. Some effects which base on uv coordinate may have problem.
